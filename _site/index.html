<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Briar, a passionate individual that believes his purpose in life is to learn as much as possible, about everything. My notable interests include robotics, natural sciences, and psychology. I believe that each of these 3 things are extremely powerful. Robotics for its social implications, the natural sciences for understanding the universe, and psychology for understanding other humans, as well as ourselves. These systems are all deeply connected to eachother, as is everything in some sort of fundamental way. I would also consider myself a writer and a philosopher, incredibly curious and open minded. I am an extrovert and love conversations with people. My friends note my ability to hold conversations, and to always have something interesting to talk about. Please take some time to check out some projects I have been a part of by visiting around my website.</p>
